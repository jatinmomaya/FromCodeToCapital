Hello, world! ðŸŽ‰ 

My name is Jatin Momaya and I am currently a product owner. My current career goals include making the transition to product manager and eventually becoming a venture capitalist.

Welcome to my new blog, a space where I'll be jotting down my thoughts, experiences, and learnings as I navigate my career journey.
Whether it's exploring new technologies, tackling challenging projects, or reflecting on personal growth, I hope to capture it all here. 
Join me as I document this ongoing adventureâ€”sharing insights, tips, and maybe even a few stories along the way!

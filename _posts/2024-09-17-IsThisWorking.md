I am basically trying to learn web development in making this website functional so I can continue adding sections like my resume. 
I probably shouldn't have used GitHub's template and just started from scratch but I'm too lazy to start over now. 
Even though I know most of the HTML and CSS basics, it's hard building a website with all the bells and whistles I want. 
Better late than never I guess. 

I want to ensure I stay consistent with this blog even if that means forcing myself to have some sort of quota of blog posts a week.
